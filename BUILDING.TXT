Building planettool
===================

In the Oolite repository
------------------------
Planettool is developed in Oolite's Subversion repository. See
<http://developer.berlios.de/projects/oolite-linux/>.

* For Mac OS X, the Xcode project is the preferred way to build. The Xcode
  project is also the only supported way to build the GUI version of
  Planet Tool.
* For other platforms, use "make inrepo=yes".


Stand-alone distribution
------------------------
* Use "make". (The Xcode project is not included with the stand-alone
  distribution.)


Troubleshooting
---------------
* If you have build problems related to the "vasprintf" function, add the
  option "asprintf=no" to the "make" command.
* If you have build problems related to the file <pthread.h> or functions
  beginning with "pthread", use the add the option "scheduer=SerialScheduler"
  to the "make" command. NOTE: if built this way, planettool will only use
  one processor core.
* If you are unsure whether planettool is functioning correctly, there is a
  test suite here (13.2 MB):
