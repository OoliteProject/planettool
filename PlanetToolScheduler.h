	Interface for schedulers.
	
	A scheduler takes a callback and a line count, and invokes the callback
	for each line value from zero to line count - 1. This may be done in
	parallel.

/*	Type for render callback.
	The callback is called for each output line. Lines may be rendered in any
	order, potentially in parallel, and must not be independent.
	
	If a render callback returns false, ScheduleRender SHALL return false and
	MAY skip other lines. Since order of rendering is not specified, the
	cancellation of particular lines cannot be guaranteed.

/*	Scheduler interface.
	
	renderCB is the function to call for each line.
	
	renderContext is an arbitrary parameter to the render callback.
	
	lineCount specifies the number of lines to be rendered.
	
	subRenderIndex and subRenderCount may be used to specify that multiple
	calls to ScheduleRender() are being used, and will determine the parameters
	passed to progressCB. For instance, when rendering to lat/long
	ScheduleRender() will be called once, so subRenderIndex is 0 and
	subRenderCount is 1, but when rendering to a cube map six invocations will
	be used, so subRenderIndex will range from 0 to 5. It is assumed lineCount
	will be the same for each invocation; if not, the caller will have to
	provide an intermediate progress callback to translate.
	
	progressCB is called for each line to report progress.
	
	progressContext is an arbitrary parameter to the progress callback.
