	Simple wrapper for system power management API. When PTStartPreventingSleep
	is called, system idle sleep is avoided to the extent possible until a
	balancing PTStopPreventingSleep call is made. Calls are counted; if
	PTStartPreventingSleep is called N times, PTStopPreventingSleep must be
	called N times to allow sleep.
